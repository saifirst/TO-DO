# 📝TO-DO App

Hello Everyone, I'm excited to share that I have crafted my first simple Flutter application named "TO-DO".

One of the best things I am using every day to manage my tasks and boost my productivity is the TO-DO list where I can put my daily, weekly, or even monthly tasks to focus on them deeply. so I created this simple app to give me the ability to track and create my TO-DO list on my phone without the need for any pens or notebooks.

# ✨Features:

✏️ Add new tasks to your TO-DO list easily by the bottom input field.

✔️ Check and uncheck the completed tasks by clicking the check box in every task box.

❌ Delete any task by swiping the task button in any horizontal direction (Left or Right) and you can undo that by the bottom snack bar.

🔍 Search for any task by typing its name in the search bar.

# ✨Next Step:

☀️🌑 User will be able to use the app in Light or Dark mode.

#### I invite you all to check out the "TO-DO" app, and I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions.
